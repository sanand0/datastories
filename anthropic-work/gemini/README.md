# Anthropic Productivity Patterns Visualization

This is a standalone HTML file containing a React application that visualizes three key engineering productivity patterns described in the article "How AI is transforming work at Anthropic".

## Features

- **Tabs:** Switch between the three key patterns (Capability Expansion, Iteration Speed, Neglected Tasks).
- **Interactive Toggle:** Switch between "Manual Workflow" (Before) and "AI Assisted" (After) to trigger animations.
- **Xenographics:** Custom SVG and CSS-based visualizations that abstractly represent the data concepts (e.g., skill radars, orbit loops, iceberg charts).
- **No External Dependencies:** The file loads React, Tailwind, and Babel via CDN, so it can be opened directly in any modern browser without a build step.

## Usage

Simply open `anthropic_productivity.html` in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.
