    <h1>The Gate</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A hidden mechanism in an LLM skills test reveals who can really think with AI—and who just uses it</p>
    <p class="byline">Analysis of 535 students • IIT Madras Tools in Data Science • November 2025</p>
    
    <p class="lead">When 535 students at IIT Madras sat down to complete a 21-question LLM skills assessment in November 2025, they didn't know they were walking into a trap. The exercise looked straightforward: use AI tools to solve a sequence of problems—extract data from PDFs, transcribe audio, compute statistics. Build one program that chains through them all.</p>
    
    <p>What they didn't realize was that buried in the design was a gate. Actually, fourteen of them.</p>

<div class="container">
    <p>My first instinct was to see this as evidence of distinct skill populations. Some students were good at AI prompting; others weren't. The multimodality reflected natural ability.</p>

    <h2>The Hidden Architecture</h2>
    
    <p>Buried in the source code of the evaluation system was a mechanism I hadn't noticed at first. The 21 questions weren't independent—they were <em>sequenced</em>. And crucially, some were <strong>gated</strong>.</p>

    <p>For the first seven questions, everyone could proceed regardless of whether they answered correctly. But question 8—a GitHub repository analysis task—was different. Get it wrong, and the system returned no next URL. You were stuck.</p>
    
    <p>Suddenly the valley in the distribution made sense. Students with 7 or fewer marks had never passed the first gate. Students with 8 or more had unlocked the second half of the assessment.</p>

    <p class="pullquote">"The gate wasn't arbitrary. It was a filter. And the filter was testing something real."</p>
    
    <p>Consider what passing the gh-tree question required. Students had to query a GitHub repository's file tree, count specific file types, and return the correct number. This demanded more than basic prompting—it required understanding API responses, parsing nested JSON, and handling edge cases.</p>
    
    <p>Students who could do this went on to solve 12+ questions on average. Students who couldn't—despite making 60, 80, even 100 attempts—remained stuck at 5-6 marks.</p>
    
    <div class="section-break"></div>
    
    <h2>The Token Question</h2>
    
    <p>There's an uncomfortable confound I can't fully resolve. Several students reported running out of API tokens as they progressed through the exercise. The assessment was designed to be solved by a single chained program—which meant token consumption compounded with each question.</p>
    
    <p>Did some students fail the gate because they lacked skill? Or because they ran out of tokens before their program could iterate to a correct solution?</p>

            <strong>These students tried hard.</strong> Average of 95 attempts, but only 5.3 marks. Were they hitting skill ceilings or resource limits? The data can't tell us definitively.
        </div>

<div class="container">
    <p>I suspect the truth is both. Token limits likely stopped some students from iterating to solutions they <em>could</em> have found. But the "same effort, different outcomes" analysis suggests that even controlling for resource constraints, genuine skill differences separated gate-passers from non-passers.</p>
    
    <p>The gate was testing ability to decompose novel problems, debug iteratively, and combine LLM capabilities in ways the questions didn't explicitly suggest. Students who could do this passed quickly. Students who couldn't burned through tokens without progress.</p>
    
    <div class="section-break"></div>
    
    <h2>The Bypass Artists</h2>
    
    <p>One final detail complicates the story. Seven students with 9-15 marks never actually solved the gh-tree gate—yet they still answered later questions. How?</p>
    
    <p>The assessment allowed manual POST requests to the /submit endpoint. These students figured out they could bypass the gate by directly submitting answers to later questions. They reverse-engineered the system.</p>
    
    <p>In a way, this is the most telling finding of all. The students who found the workaround demonstrated exactly the kind of creative problem-solving the assessment was designed to measure. They didn't let a structural barrier stop them—they thought around it.</p>
    
    <div class="callout-box">
        <h3>The Three Populations, Revised</h3>
        <p><strong>Early Exiters (25%):</strong> 133 students stopped before reaching the gate. Low engagement—average 10 attempts. They may have run out of time, interest, or tokens before seriously attempting the harder questions.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Gate-Blocked (19%):</strong> 103 students tried the gate but couldn't pass. High effort—average 50+ attempts. They hit a genuine skill ceiling on complex LLM problem-solving.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Gate-Passers (37%):</strong> 195 students passed the first gate and unlocked the rest of the assessment. Average 12.7 marks. Once past the filter, they succeeded on most subsequent questions (often 90%+ success rates).</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section-break"></div>
    
    <h2>What This Means</h2>
    
    <p>The gated structure of this assessment created a cleaner test of LLM problem-solving ability than a traditional exam would have. By forcing students through a skill filter early, it separated those who could <em>think with</em> AI tools from those who could only <em>use</em> them for straightforward tasks.</p>
    
    <p>The finding that matters: <strong>37% of students demonstrated genuinely higher LLM problem-solving ability</strong>, as evidenced by their success on questions that required complex reasoning, iteration, and tool orchestration. Another 19% tried hard but couldn't cross the threshold. And 25% never seriously engaged.</p>
    
    <p>For educators designing AI curricula, the implication is clear. Exposure to LLM tools isn't enough. Students need deliberate practice on the <em>meta-skill</em> of working with AI—decomposing problems, debugging prompts, recognizing when an approach isn't working, and pivoting to alternatives.</p>
    
    <p>The gate was harsh. But it measured something real.</p>

            <h4>Methodology & Limitations</h4>
            <p><strong>Data:</strong> 535 students who submitted at least one response to Project 2 of the IIT Madras Tools in Data Science course, November 2025. A "mark" = one unique question solved correctly. Gate-passers identified by successful completion of the gh-tree question.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Structural Insight:</strong> Questions with difficulty rating ≤2 allowed progression regardless of correctness. Questions with difficulty ≥3 were gated—students only received the next question if they answered correctly. The first gate was question 8 (gh-tree).</p>
            <p><strong>What I can't untangle:</strong> Skill vs. token limits. Some students may have failed gates due to running out of API budget rather than lacking ability. The "same effort, different outcomes" analysis controls for this partially, but not completely. Prior domain knowledge, access to better tools, and time invested per attempt are also unobserved.</p>
            <p><strong>What remains robust:</strong> Students with similar attempt counts ended up with dramatically different scores depending on gate passage. This suggests genuine skill differences, not just structural luck.</p>
