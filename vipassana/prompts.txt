I attended a 10-day Vipassana meditation center.	Comic panel showing the protagonist, a man wearing a T-shirt, standing in front of a peaceful, simple building with a sign indicating "Vipassana Meditation Center" in Chennai, with serene trees around, early morning light.
Each day had 12 hours of meditation, ...	Panel depicting the protagonist sitting cross-legged on a meditation cushion in a quiet hall with other men meditating silently, clocks on the wall showing long hours.

3 hours rest...	Panel showing the protagonist relaxing quietly on a bench outside the meditation hall, maybe reading a book or simply sitting calmly.
... and 2 hours to eat.	Panel showing the protagonist at a communal dining hall eating a simple, basic meal with others, utensils and plates shown, no excess food.
You live like a monk. It's a hostel life.	Panel showing the protagonist walking down a clean, simple corridor lined with modest rooms, carrying a towel, emphasizing simplicity and communal living.
The food is basic. You wash utensils and your room.	Panel showing the protagonist washing metal utensils at a sink in a modest kitchen, focused and silent.
There are rules. No phone, laptop, no communication.	Panel depicting the protagonist putting away his phone and laptop in a locked box with a slight expression of acceptance.
You can't speak to anyone. As an introvert, I enjoyed this!	Panel showing the protagonist sitting peacefully alone in the meditation hall, eyes closed, serene smile, with other men distant and silent.
You can't kill. Sparing cockroaches and mosquitos were hard.	Panel showing the protagonist looking at a small cockroach on the floor hesitating to swat it, with a mosquito flying nearby.
You can't mix meditations. But I continued daily Yoga.	Panel showing the protagonist doing yoga asana stretches.
You can't steal. But I did smuggle a peanut chikki out.	Panel showing the protagonist slyly hiding a small piece of peanut chikki inside his shirt pocket, looking around cautiously.
No intoxicants or sexual misconducts.	Panel showing the protagonist thinking about drinking alcohol, which is banned.
You're woken up by bell at 4 am daily.	Panel showing the protagonist sitting up suddenly in bed in a dimly lit dormitory as a hand bell is rung by a staff member outside.
You sit cross-legged without moving, which I found impossible.	Panel showing the protagonist attempting to sit cross-legged on a meditation cushion with a strained expression and twitching body.
I was the sole attendee who needed a backrest.	Panel showing the protagonist sitting on a cushion with a portable backrest behind him, while others sit upright unsupported.

You observe your sensations calmly.	Panel showing the protagonist meditating with closed eyes, with a subtle aura or light ripple effect around his head to visually represent calm observation.

It's pragmatic. Accept what works. Reject what doesn't.	Panel showing the protagonist thoughtfully sitting, with a balanced scale in background symbolizing decision-making.
There's no dogma. More science than religion.	Panel showing scientific symbols like brainwaves or neurons blending with a meditation pose illustration, emphasizing rationality.
I discovered several cravings and aversions	Panel showing the protagonist noticing small floating icons representing cravings (like money, food) and aversions (like fear symbols) around him, with curiosity.
... like fear of losing money and an efficiency obsession.	Panel showing the protagonist looking worried, with visual hints of money symbols and clocks floating near his head.
Also that humor, curiosity and compassion really help.	Panel showing the protagonist smiling gently while helping another meditator, showing warmth and a light-hearted expression.
It was 10 days well spent. I strongly recommend it.	Panel showing the protagonist walking away happily from the meditation center at sunset with a calm smile, peaceful surroundings behind him.
