```markdown
Read researcher-of-the-future/researcher-of-the-future.pdf carefully.

Pick the 6 most important, rich, data-driven sections (e.g. with complex, detailed charts).
Convert those into rich, highly interactive data visualizations.

Package these this into a beautiful slide deck, McKinsey style.
Make the slides content rich, i.e. clear and self-explanatory with enough detail to help the audience understand without a narrator.
Each page includes the interactive data visualization prominently.
Use iconography, typography, stock images, etc. as appropriate.
Write as a single page HTML application in the style of the rest of the data stories.

Commit as you go.
