## What you'll see

The visualization displays:

- **Circles representing movies**: Each circle is a film, with bigger circles meaning higher box office earnings
- **Colors showing earning ranges**: From blue (lower earnings) to red (massive blockbusters)
- **Interactive features**: Hover over any circle to see movie details, click to visit its Wikipedia page
- **Inflation adjustment**: Toggle to see what historical earnings would be worth in today's money

## Key insights revealed

- **Dangal (2016)** holds the record with â‚¹2,160 crores worldwide
- The **2013-2016 period** was particularly golden for Bollywood blockbusters
- **Franchise films** (sequels) dominate the highest earning spots
- Box office numbers have grown dramatically over the decades
- Recent hits like **Jawan** and **Stree 2** show strong post-pandemic recovery

- Highest-grossing Bollywood films by year
- Worldwide box office collections in Indian Rupees (crores)
