Claude, reveal whether questions actually find answers. Make the journey from a search to its first destination feel tangible — hopeful when swift, curious when meandering. Focus on empathy: everyone googles in loops; clarity comes from seeing the loops.

Effect/mood to evoke

- Curiosity resolved: quick funnels feel like a small win.
- Discovery vs. dithering: some terms scatter to many sites; others converge.
- Practicality: readers pick up how to craft searches that land.

Using/redoing the analysis

- Identify search visits via `keyword_search_terms` and find first click-throughs using `visits.from_visit`.
- Re-run SQL on `file:$HOME/.config/microsoft-edge/Default/History?mode=ro&immutable=1`.
- Compute `time_to_click_sec` as `(dest.visit_time - search.visit_time)/1e6` and aggregate by `normalized_term`.

What each CSV contains and how it was generated

- search_funnels_terms.csv — per normalized search term: search_events, clicks, click_rate, avg_time_to_click_sec, unique_dest_domains, top_dest_domain (+ clicks/share), total_dest_foreground_sec.
- search_destinations.csv — for each term × destination domain: clicks, avg_time_to_click_sec, total_dest_foreground_sec.
- search_samples.csv — sample term → destination titles with timestamps (anonymize as needed in publication).

Let the visual channel your taste. The goal is to make “question → answer” emotionally legible.
