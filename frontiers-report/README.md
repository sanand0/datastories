# The Paper Trail: Inside the Hidden War on Scientific Fraud

A narrative-driven scrollytelling story based on the Frontiers Annual Report 2024, exploring the crisis of scientific fraud and how AI is being deployed to fight back.

## The Story

This data story reveals a shocking truth: in 2023, over 10,000 scientific papers were retracted—more than in the previous three years combined. Paper mills are industrializing fraud, AI is enabling mass production of fake research, and the integrity of scientific publishing is under siege.

But there's a counter-narrative. Frontiers, one of the world's leading open access publishers, has made research integrity the centerpiece of their strategy. Their 2024 annual report reveals that **more than 50% of all article rejections** come from their research integrity team—not from peer reviewers assessing scientific merit, but from specialists hunting fraud.

## Key Insights

- **13,000+ retractions** in 2023, the highest in history
- **43% of retractions** are due to fraud or suspected fraud
- **50%+ of Frontiers rejections** are for integrity issues
- **60+ automated quality checks** screen every submission
- **94% researcher satisfaction** despite rigorous screening
- **4 billion downloads** of Frontiers articles globally
- **90 journals** improved their Impact Factor year-over-year

## Writing Style

Inspired by Malcolm Gladwell's approach:
- Human-scale narrative that makes data relatable
- "Wait, really?" moments that reframe understanding
- Evidence woven naturally into prose
- Specific examples that make abstractions concrete
- Honest acknowledgment of limitations
- Clear implications for action
